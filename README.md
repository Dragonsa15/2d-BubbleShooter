# What is this ?

2D bubble shooter game in python using Pygame library.

## About

We are making game using python and pygame. The game developing concepts are being learnt online, through tutorial videos and books provided online. We have tried on thinking on two games, one  based on Bubble Trouble, and another one based on Street Fighter. 

Bubble Trouble: There will be a character in the game, which will represent the player playing the game. The character is provided with a gun which will shoot bullets (or whatever finalised), on the bubble, that will be bouncing on and besde the player. The bubble has to be completely destroyed in order to move on to the next level. The bubble, when hits the player, will reduce the energy or kill it. Thre controls will be basic arrow  keys and the spacebar for shooting. It will be a simple single player arcade game.

Street Fighter: The initial screen will allow us to select the player, we want to choose. It will be multiplayer, so at a time  two players have to play together. We are planning on adding the AI feature, so that we can let the CPU handle the other player. The next screen will take us to a fighting arena, which will let the two players, fight against each other. Energy bar will be there for both the players, which will reduce in accompliance with the hits and punches. We are yet planning to add a story line to it, based on the player you choose and continue with the game, by incoming random oppenents. But, this will be include only if we do CPU based, and not just two player game. The controls will be on the keypad and arrow keys for moving. There will be one key for punch and one for kick too.

We haven't yet finalised the game which we will be making, but it will be either of these two only. We have worked on learning the various concepts like jumping, collisions, projectiles etc. We hope we come up with a successful game, that will be enthralling and addictive.
