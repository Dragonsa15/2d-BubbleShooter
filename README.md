# What is this ?

2D bubble shooter game in python using Pygame library.

## About

We are making game using python and pygame. The game developing concepts are being learnt online, through tutorial videos and books provided online. We have tried on thinking on two games, one  based on Bubble Trouble, and another one based on Street Fighter. 

Bubble Trouble: There will be a character in the game, which will represent the player playing the game. The character is provided with a gun which will shoot bullets (or whatever finalised), on the bubble, that will be bouncing on and besde the player. The bubble has to be completely destroyed in order to move on to the next level. The bubble, when hits the player, will reduce the energy or kill it. Thre controls will be basic arrow  keys and the spacebar for shooting. It will be a simple single player arcade game.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

Just run the following command and enjoy the game.
```python
python Game.py
```
